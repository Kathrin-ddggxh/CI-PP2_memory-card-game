## Design

This game was designed with simple, intuitive functionality in mind. All features are self-explanetory and the game itself is rather common, thus the rules are well known. But even without initial understanding of the game, the user is able quickly figure out how to play it by trying out the site's different features.

### Font and Colour choices

**Fonts:** Fonts were chosen to match the style of the One Punch Man manga as closely as possible.

**Colours:** The main colour scheme follows the design of the anime, maintaining a dark mood based on the main red colour found in Saitama's (One Punch Man protagonist) cape, gloves and boots.
